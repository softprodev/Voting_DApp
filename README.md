# Decentralized Decisions DApp

The first vote session, vote 0, will go live on December 27th. The Decentralized Decisions software allows for votes to be held on issues for the Choice Coin DAO, enabling a new form of direct and decentralized democratic decision making mechanism. The software leverages the Algorand blockchain to provide a new, scalable, and secure voting technology.

# Run Steps
To run locally, cd into the directory and run *sh run.sh* from your terminal. This will open up a local server running the react app.
