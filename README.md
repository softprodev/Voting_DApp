# Decentralized Decisions DApp

The Decentralized Decisions software allows for votes to be held on issues for the Choice Coin DAO, enabling a new form of direct and decentralized democratic decision making. The software leverages the Algorand blockchain to provide a new, scalable, and secure voting technology.

# Run Steps
To run locally, cd into the directory and run *sh run.sh* from your terminal. This will open up a local server running the React App. 
Make sure to have some Testnet Choice, either by creating a new asset or obtaining some from TinyMan's Testnet site: https://testnet.tinyman.org/#/swap?asset_in=0&asset_out=21364625. Be sure to alter the asset id parameter under *constants* in the *frontend* folder if you create a new asset id.

# Vote 0

The first vote session, Vote 0, will go live on December 27th.
